# Microservices Deployment & Beta Testing Roadmap

This document outlines the phased deployment strategy for the four core microservices using Docker, culminating in a beta testing phase. The deployment order is based on service dependencies to ensure a stable and logical rollout.

---

## Deployment Prerequisites

1.  **Docker Environment**: A stable Docker environment (e.g., Docker Desktop, or a dedicated server with Docker Engine and Docker Compose) is set up and running.
2.  **Configuration Management**: A centralized and secure method for managing environment variables for each service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or simple `.env` files for initial testing) is in place.
3.  **Shared Network**: A Docker network is established to allow the services to communicate with each other by their service names.

## Phased Deployment Plan

The deployment is structured into phases, with each phase building upon the previous one.

### Phase 1: Foundational Services (Authentication & User Identity)

This phase establishes the core identity and authentication capabilities of the system.

1.  **Deploy `authentication-service`**:
    *   **Action**: Build the Docker image and run the container.
    *   **Reasoning**: This is the foundational service. No other service can function without the ability to authenticate users and issue tokens. It has no dependencies on the other three services.

2.  **Deploy `user-management-service`**:
    *   **Action**: Build the Docker image and run the container.
    *   **Reasoning**: This service manages the core entities (users, roles, permissions) that the authorization service will rely on. It depends on the `authentication-service` to protect its administrative endpoints.

3.  **Internal Verification**:
    *   Confirm that the `authentication-service` can register and authenticate users.
    *   Confirm that an authenticated administrator can use the `user-management-service` to create, read, update, and delete users, roles, and permissions.

### Phase 2: Core Logic (Authorization)

This phase introduces the central access control mechanism.

1.  **Deploy `authorization-service`**:
    *   **Action**: Build the Docker image and run the container.
    *   **Reasoning**: This service is the gatekeeper. It depends on the `authentication-service` (to identify the user) and the `user-management-service` (to fetch policies/permissions).

2.  **Internal Verification**:
    *   Test the authorization endpoints directly to ensure they correctly grant or deny access based on the policies defined in the `user-management-service`.
    *   Begin integrating and testing the other services' authentication middleware against this service.

### Phase 3: Feature Services (User-Facing Features)

This phase deploys the final service that provides direct value to the end-user.

1.  **Deploy `account-management-service`**:
    *   **Action**: Build the Docker image and run the container.
    *   **Reasoning**: This service allows users to manage their own profiles. It depends on the `authentication-service` (to identify the user) and the `authorization-service` (to ensure the user can only access their own data).

2.  **Internal Verification**:
    *   Perform end-to-end tests. For example, a test user should be able to log in (`authentication-service`), be authorized (`authorization-service`), and successfully update their profile (`account-management-service`).

---

## Phase 4: Integration & Beta Testing

With all services deployed and internally verified, the system is ready for external testing.

1.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**:
    *   **Action**: Execute a comprehensive suite of automated E2E tests that simulate real user workflows across all four services.
    *   **Goal**: Catch any remaining integration bugs and validate that the system as a whole functions as expected.

2.  **Beta Launch**:
    *   **Action**: Onboard a limited, controlled group of beta testers.
    *   **Goal**: Gather feedback on usability, functionality, and performance from real users in a production-like environment.

3.  **Monitoring & Feedback Collection**:
    *   **Action**: Actively monitor the aggregated logs (e.g., using a centralized logging solution like the ELK stack or Datadog) and performance metrics for all services.
    *   **Goal**: Proactively identify issues, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement. Establish a clear channel for beta testers to report bugs and provide feedback.

## Post-Beta & Production Launch

1.  **Analyze Feedback**: Review all collected data and user feedback.
2.  **Prioritize & Iterate**: Create a backlog of bug fixes, performance enhancements, and feature requests.
3.  **Go/No-Go Decision**: Make a final decision on whether the system is ready for a full production launch.
4.  **Production Deployment**: Plan and execute the full launch to all users.
